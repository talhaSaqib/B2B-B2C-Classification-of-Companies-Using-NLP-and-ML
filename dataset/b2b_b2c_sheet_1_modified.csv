Our approach is backed with tangible, measurable results. Financial stability and profitability since our beginning in 1979 prove we are in fact, on to something.

The complexity of current IT environments is daunting given the number of choices available for hardware, software, management, and deployment. The challenge becomes balancing costs, performance, and functionality with the new “must haves,” such as: anytime, anywhere access to real-time information; global customers, employees and partners; and rich multimedia content, applications, and services. There are benefits of new technologies yet companies are struggling with the perceived risks and other barriers to adoption. Changing models without full consideration of all these factors can lead to sub optimal outcomes.

Pull IT together with a comprehensive plan; an open view of your current state. Our enterprise architects will listen to your challenges, talk about current trends in your industry, and learn more about how you do business. Then we can identify the gaps and any other areas where Meridian’s “Map Methodology” can address those issues and concerns and provide a custom map that will lead to your unique future.

We believe in extraordinary customer relationships. Our people cultivate strategic partnerships by conveying knowledge, providing tools, and expressing useful points of view to help clients understand and clarify their needs.

Delphiis specializes in healthcare, helping many of the leading academic and hospital systems effectively and cost efficiently strengthen the power of their information security departments ensuring patient safety across the enterprise. 

The Story Behind Delphiis:

After decades in the information security industry and consulting for many Fortune 500 and Global 1000 organizations, Delphiis saw and heard the same problems over and over again with very little variation. Delphiis founder Mike Gentile went so far as to co-author multiple books on the topic, CISO Handbook and CISO Soft Skills.

Delphiis discovered that there are huge gaps in the development of healthy security systems within most organizations. At the same time, the environment in which most security programs must survive are also becoming more and more difficult to navigate. Delphiis' mantra is simple: control what you can. As there are factors outside of your control like budgetary constraints, workload, threats, infrastructures, culture, and so on.

The core DNA that has been embedded into Delphiis' Risk Management Automation application is Delphiis' ability to collaborate and execute through simple-but-effective methodology used in projects in leading organizations around the world. 

Delphiis has quickly learned that its not just a security company, it is is an execution company. It is Delphiis' passion and goal to change the information security landscape as we know it.",1,1,helping many of the leading academic and hospital systems,,San Clemente,Orange County,CA,,United States,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],200

San Diego Data Processing Corporation (SDDPC) was created by The City of San Diego in 1979 to provide a vehicle outside of the City’s wage and hour structure to insure that the City had the best and brightest people to manage The City of San Diego Data communications infrastructure.  

Over the years, SDDPC managed nearly all aspects of that data infrastructure including voice and data communications, programs and processes, and coordination of activities that impacted the applications that the various City departments used. SDDPC demonstrated tremendous skills in applications development for various programs in support of City government and those applications were used by many municipalities.  In addition, SDDPC had tremendous capabilities in purchasing and contracting and supported other Cities besides San Diego in this area as well. In 2010 The City of San Diego decided to move in a new direction and ultimately put out an RFP to allow others to bid on the activities that SDDPC had been performing on behalf of the City.  That bid process resulted in an award to 3 different vendors for the work SDDPC had been performing.  Xerox was awarded the telecommunications component of the ongoing work, Atos was awarded the data center component, and CGI was awarded the applications component. The City then substantially increased the DoIT staff to manage these three vendors.  These awards resulted in the decision to close SDDPC on or about December 31, 2013.  While we are disappointed with that decision, we take pride in our accomplishments as an organization and want to thank the thousands of dedicated employees through the years that made it all possible.

The acquired online service includes proprietary price assessments, futures prices and other exchange data, and third-party assessments of market prices around the world. The acquisition will further increase the range of Argus information available to the metals sector.

Founded in 1995, MetalPrices’ main focus is price assessments for open-market or over-the-counter (OTC) metal products — reporting the prices of metals that are not listed on the major exchanges, but which are essential to global trade. The company publishes nearly 300 metals price assessments each week. These proprietary assessments are trusted for indexation and market analysis especially in North American ferrous and non-ferrous secondary metal markets. The data are available through the MetalPrices.com website and through weekly publications, Ferrous Scrap Price Index Daily and Heavy Melt Weekly and News Flash.

Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks said: “MetalPrices is a natural fit for Argus’ expanding energy and commodities portfolio. In recent years we have increased our metals coverage to include iron ore, coking coal and metallurgical coke services as well as coverage of the ferro-alloy, minor metals and rare earth markets through our purchase of Metal-Pages in May 2014. This acquisition complements this and extends Argus’ global coverage of metals markets.”

MetalPrices.com president Marc Dulin said: “We are delighted to become part of Argus as it deepens its metals coverage.

Dedicated On Demand – Customer transition work packages completely to On-Demand

Projects – Customers directly manage their own projects utilizing the Suryl Nexus toolset to build and flow work instructions directly to the workforce.

Our Secret Sauce:

Suryl Nexus – Gives your business direct access to the “On Demand” workforce to complete any job. No job is too small or too large for the On Demand workforce. Suryl Nexus takes your existing work orders in any format (email, text file, spreadsheet, etc.), parses the information and translates it into a standard work order that we can pass to our network of 3 million+ providers.

Onboarding – During the two-week onboarding process, Suryl analysts will gather information about your environment, locations, SLA’s and service provider requirements. This information will translate into the business rules in Suryl Nexus that will help create standard work orders and assist us in downselecting the right providers for your job.

Dispatch/Project Management – Not all dispatches and projects are created equally. Suryl Nexus provides us with alerting to inform our project management team at each step of your event or task. Our Dispatch Management team will action those based on agreed upon business rules to make sure your customer needs are met and successful completion.",,,,,"1100 N Tustin Avenue, Ste 101",Anaheim,Ca,92807,United States,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],200

Tesia was acquired by Renaissance Electronic Services (RES) in 2008.  Its operations were located in Long Island, NY and have since been consolidated into the RES campuses in Indianapolis.  

Tesia began operations in 1991 and was the original pioneer of real-time claim processing.  Real-time claim processing is where an office submits a claim and receives the adjudicated results within seconds.  Insurance companies with real-time claim processing receive an average of 12% more of their claims electronically.  The insurance company lowers its processing costs and the office benefits with a higher quality transaction enabling them to collect from the patient at the time of service.  

Tesia developed two proprietary technologies to enable this service.  The first was a modified credit card terminal that allowed an office to submit a real-time claim.  The second was a customized terminal emulation process that logged into their system like a claims examiner and entered the claim.  The results were then translated into a standardized explanation of benefits and returned to the office.  

The predominate use of practice management systems to create claims made the need for the modified terminal obsolete and accordingly, was phased out in 2012.  The terminal emulation technology is still be used today to enable insurance companies to process claims in real-time without having to upgrade their processing system.  This process is also being used to create a more valuable benefit and claim status transaction.

When acquired, Tesia was processing 10 million claims annually with revenue of $2.5 million.  In 2015, Tesia will process over 65 million claims with revenue of $16 million.  It is the second largest dental clearinghouse and largest processor of real-time dental claims.",,,,,1540 W.

“We believe we’re in the service business—not the sales business.”

In 1981, I founded The Stewart Organization as a copier sales and service dealer. We had a handful of clients and a small office. Thirty years later, we've grown into one of the largest document equipment dealers in North America. Our business spans more than forty-five states, and we've opened offices in the major cities in Texas.

We've seen a lot of changes, but one thing that's remained consistent is our commitment to being a good partner. We believe we're in the service business—not the sales business—and we've built our company on that foundation. That means you'll work with highly-trained employees, from technicians to executives, that have been with us for years. Their experience and knowledge will help grow your business efficiently. It also means we won't up-sell you, because our staff is compensated on total performance, not short-term profits.

From our infrastructure to our attitude, we gear everything towards being your partner—for the long run. It's how we do business at The Stewart Organization.

If you’re looking to make your mark, this could be it.

Welcome to Common Securitization Solutions (CSS)—a joint venture between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, established to build a universal platform for the issuance and management of mortgage securities. This common securitization platform will help the overall mortgage finance system run more efficiently and with greater transparency and liquidity.  Which, in turn, helps anyone who owns a home or wants to buy one. 

To help us build it, we’re looking for a diverse group of talented individuals who believe in the value of teamwork, integrity, excellence, execution, respect, and balance. We’re at an early stage in our development, and are looking to fill the following key positions: software engineers, senior architects, quality assurance professionals, analysts, finance professionals, planners and strategy development experts. 

Some of the most successful people in our organization are those with an entrepreneurial spirit, being equal parts creative, analytical and collegial. CSS is a collaborative environment that encourages contribution from every member of our team. Our mantra is Run Common — this means we work closely with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to help them build a common platform. How we’re doing this, though, is rather uncommon. We’re using Agile principles to foster rapid development, face-to-face communication and continuous action. And together, we’re creating something remarkable.
