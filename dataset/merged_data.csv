To us, it’s not about selling the most pieces of equipment or software solutions; it’s about easing the stress that technology and inefficiency plagues businesses with on a daily basis.  About providing information-handling processes that increase performance and reduce cost of input, output and management. We don’t do this to be “different”, we do this because it’s the only way to achieve what we set out to do:  ensure that when a client begins a partnership with us, their lives become easier and their business runs better.  If at the end of it all if we haven’t simplified things on your end and improved your business’ information processes, we haven’t done our job right.  

This is what we’re about.  This is what we’ve spend the last 65+ years doing.  Making your business run better so you can move on to the next task at hand.    We hope to partner with you some day and play a small part in creating the best technology solution for your business.",1.0

These face-to-face conversation simulations allow users to acquire information, practice, and build different skills, such as making a sale, screening a patient for alcohol abuse, criminal investigative interviews, and employee performance counseling. SIMmersion simulations use a patented non-branching logic that gives users a new experience with each conversation. Video-based characters are used to create life-like, challenging situations. Instant feedback from an on-screen coach, instant replay, and a post-assessment allow users to learn without the need for any outside support.

Users converse with characters who have fully-developed personalities, motives, emotions, and memories that change each time the simulation is played. Users talk with the characters using a microphone, or they may select what to say by using a mouse. The characters decide how to respond based on the rapport built between themselves and the user, the history of the conversation, and several other factors. This results in realistic, highly-engaging conversations that are never the same twice.

Using a Collective Impact framework, Zone 126 works to break the cycle of poverty from cradle to career. 

The Problem
More than 20,000 families are living in concentrated pockets of poverty in Astoria and Long Island City. Over 8,000 are children. Our children are living in generational poverty facing multiple environmental, social, and physical barriers to academic success. These children attend ten K-12th schools which are not only lacking the necessary resources to combat these barriers, but individual organizations have not had success in increasing academic achievement.

Zone 126, as the backbone organization in a Collective Impact framework, coordinates a cross-sector effort with community organizations, public agencies, and private supporters who together provide the necessary programs for academic support, enrichment, health, nutrition, parent education, and youth development. We are coordinating improvements at every stage of a child’s life, from cradle to career. 
Local and national research-based programs operate in each of the ten schools within our Zone. Zone 126 also acts as the evaluator of the short-, mid-, and long-term impact of these programs and services on the academic achievement and socio-emotional gains of participating children and families. Every child can succeed with consistent, effective programs. Comprehensive cradle to career services are fundamental to ultimately breaking the cycle of poverty.

WhyTry began in January of 1996, when a professor asked Christian Moore how he had come so far academically despite his severe learning differences. At the time, Christian was fighting for a bachelor's degree at a large university with sixth-grade math abilities and seventh-grade reading and writing skills.

As Christian thought about this question, he wrote the words, “Why Try?” on the top of a piece of paper. Below the question, he wrote 15 principles that he used to overcome his challenges. Later, while in graduate school, Christian began using pictures to teach his ""WhyTry"" principles as a counselor at an alternative high school. He recognized that the youth he was helping were overwhelmingly visual learners, so talking to them was always going to have a limited effect. He presented his ideas and visual tools to a local school district, which used them to reduce truancy and failure in their most at-risk students.

The WhyTry Program is now in use in over 16,000 schools and 500 school districts in all 50 states and countries worldwide. Christian Moore has become an internationally renowned speaker, addressing over 100 conferences and workshops each year. The WhyTry organization he started is growing dramatically with the single aim of helping people overcome their challenges to achieve success in school and for the rest of their lives.",2.0

We have established our undying mission in 4 distinct areas: your child(ren), you as a (grand)parent, our staff as professionals, and the neighborhood we serve.

Your child(ren): It is our philosophy to enable children to learn and grow through play. We focus on the whole child, developing their social, emotional, physical, cognitive and language skills. We count it a privilege to partner with parents to love, nurture and train their children. We approach every aspect with this in mind.

You as a (grand)parent: Whether this is your first child or you have a large family, we count ourselves as part of your family. That means we stay open when other centers close, so you can get to your job or school and not worry about how your child is being cared for. We also work with you to honor, respect and continue your parenting preferences for how you wish to raise your child(ren).

Our staff as professionals: Sadly, expectations for childcare workers are often not very high. For us, it's more than just babysitting. We expect that our staff ""go the extra mile"" to assure that your child experiences multiple learning experiences throughout the day.

566,"The Challenge:
67% of American women wear sizes 14+—that’s 100 million women. Yet this majority is systematically underserved by the retail industry. The plus size community faces paltry options, unwelcoming environments, and a lack of representation—all adding up to a disappointing experience with style.

Our Vision:
To spark radical self-love through style

The Dia&Co Solution:
Dia&Co is the only retail service dedicated to meeting the plus size community’s full range of style needs. We’re applying the best of data and technology to serve women who have been ignored for far too long—from developing the shopping experiences she’s always wanted, to building community platforms that inspire her, to ensuring she sees herself represented in the world around her.

Our Approach — Representative Retail:
Dia&Co is a company built around a customer, not a business model. Our community leads the way, and we meet their unique needs by creating products and experiences across three comprehensive areas of service:

Commerce:
Curated access to the best-fitting Style and Active apparel (led
by Dia&Co’s beloved owned brands), fully equipping her to express herself through style. Customized shopping experiences to remove the stress around fit, for a joyful and fabulous experience.

Community:
Platforms to foster deep connections between members both of offline and online, offering a place for her to be celebrated and to celebrate others through style.

Change:
Campaigns to create lasting change by combating stereotypes and biases. Advocacy to increase representation of our community outside the Dia ecosystem, so she can see herself reflected in style.",3.0
567,"We are all busy. Busy with our career, the kids, the household and maintaining a satisfying social life. Preferably, all at the same time. We want to enjoy our precious time off, but planning a night out and finding a suitable, trustworthy babysitter often leads to more stress instead of less. Especially when a last minute opportunity presents itself. This way, your social calendar is determined by the availability of a babysitter. The freedom of young (urban) parents is under pressure. As a parent you desire flexibility, but you also want to close the door behind you with a confident feeling when you leave your most prized possession with a sitter.

Charly Cares offers a solution for these problems by providing an online platform, utilizing the newest innovative technical tools, with reliability as our number one priority. Our mission is to give busy (urban) parents more control over their social calendar and give them back some of their freedom.

HYLA Mobile’s approach delivers economic, environmental and social benefits to the partners, consumers and communities it serves.

HYLA Mobile began in 2009 when a group of people saw an opportunity to “do well by doing good.” Our founders, who are leaders and entrepreneurs in the telecommunications and mass retail industries, noticed a growing issue in the mobile device industry: e-waste.

This waste, however, comes in many forms. Waste in the form of cell phones being thrown into drawers or, worse, in the trash where they ended up in landfills, or in the form of economic assets that were not being utilized; and waste in the form of additional natural resources used to create even more mobile devices. At the same time, consumers were (and still are) clamoring for the latest and greatest mobile devices, creating even more used devices. All of which presented our founders with a huge opportunity: to redirect millions of used mobile devices into the hands of people who could use them to enhance their lives.

1041,"Our Story:

It all started when we had some savings ourselves and couldn’t figure out what to do with them. Everyone tells you to budget and save. But no one tells you what to do after that. You know you should be doing something smart with your money, but who do you listen to? You’ve read about cryptocurrencies, researched robo advisors but when it came down to it, you didn't feel confident in handing over your money. A financial advisor could help you, but you either don’t trust them or can’t afford to pay them.

We dare to envisage a world where you don’t need a financial advisor – much as you no longer need a travel agent thanks to the likes of Expedia. Just as you do with films, restaurants and hotels, we see a world where you consult an independent platform before making any financial decision.

Our first product is our daily newsletter that explains what’s happening in the world of finance in 3 minutes and without any jargon. This has attracted 200,000 readers – but removing financial jargon is just the first step in levelling the playing field. Since then we have expanded our team, and grown our community around the world!

The next step in our mission is making your voice heard by building the “TripAdvisor” for finance. We’ve built this awesome new app where you can read user-generated reviews on a range of financial products, and therefore have the ability to figure out what to do with your money.

Door combines the same principals and culture across residential real estate brokerage, mortgage and title - a team-centric commitment to client service through specialization, full-time non-commissioned experts, and a belief that technology can support and improve the experience and outcomes in home ownership.

Our agents and loan officers spend 100% of their time working with clients rather than lead generation. We believe the traditional 100% commission, contractor model does not align with client interests. Our success in delivering the best outcomes in real estate can be independently measured by our Zillow rating of 4.9 out of 5.0. 

The Door Difference:

Technology as service enabler: We build technology to increase access, transparency and insights for clients in their  real estate journey. 

Specialization : The real estate process requires a very wide range of skills, and the only way to manage each component of the process well is to specialize. Door agents & experts specialize in areas like project management,  marketing, lead management, home valuation, transaction coordination and negotiation to ensure each agent is focused on what they do best. This leads to happier agents and much better outcomes for clients.

Keep More of their Home Equity : Since our agents focus only on client service (instead of lead generation), they are able to close many more transactions per month than a traditional agent - and with very high client satisfaction scores. That enables Door to charge far less in fees, and for our clients to keep more of their hard-earned equity.

As of today we have over 500,000 women using the app, who are beyond happy to have not only found a contraceptive that is right for them but one that allows them to get to know their bodies and cycles better. Because Natural Cycles is not just contraception, it's so much more. Because no matter what your choice is, we truly believe that every woman should know that understanding how your cycle works matters. 

The idea of Natural Cycles came about when the founders, Elina and Raoul, were in search of an effective method of natural contraception. Going from physics straight into health tech for women. The couple was unsatisfied with what they found and both having been active for many years in research in Physics, they decided to apply their knowledge in advanced mathematics and data analysis to develop a solution to meet their needs. An algorithm that accurately detects and predicts ovulation and fertility.

In the beginning, they used the algorithm for their own purposes but soon realised that this was a huge unmet need amongst women and decided to develop a mobile app. That way women from all over the world could easily access and use Natural Cycles.

Our company has been up and running for more than 4 years now and has been rapidly growing since it's certification in February 2017. At Natural Cycles we are always looking for passionate talents to help us strive for change in such a complex, scientific and controversial field. We have women's best interest at heart and work hard every single day to ensure to provide the best possible solution we can. That’s why each and every team member is passionate about what we do.

Advanced APIs allow our consumers to programmatically interact with our systems, automate their operations, and build applications on top of our services. Our customers range from Mexican nationals wishing to invest in bitcoin through corporations looking to ease cross-border payment pains.

There are a number of Bitcoin exchanges around the world, but few are as well-placed as Bitso. Mexico is the endpoint of the largest remittance corridor in the world (originating in the U.S.); one that in 2015 was reported at over $25 billion USD and expected to keep growing. The 15th largest economy in the world, Mexico has free trade agreements with 46 countries. 2014 exports amounted to over $405 billion USD, imports to over $407 billion.
Mexico's vibrant citizens are young (median age is 27 years), well communicated (mobile subscription penetration is over 91%), and have growing access to internet (penetration in 2014 was 43% with 15% growth). This makes Mexico an excellent candidate to migrate towards faster, safer, and cheaper cross-border payments that leverage state of the art technology.

We are strongly driven by a desire to improve the inefficient business models of remittance companies, and have witnessed first-hand the disproportionately high fees paid by underprivileged Mexicans living in the US who send aid money home. Our hope is to make a positive impact in this space - a social mission which is our single biggest motivator.

1546,"Cognoa is developing AI-based digital diagnostics and personalized therapies that are designed to make earlier diagnoses and effective treatments available to more children to improve outcomes and lower behavioral healthcare costs. When more physicians are empowered to identify and begin treating behavioral conditions and developmental delays earlier, more children have the opportunity to benefit from treatments at a younger age when there is the greatest potential for improved lifelong outcomes. Cognoa currently provides the Cognoa Child Development app via partnerships with employers, payees, and ABA therapy centers to empower parents and caregivers to better support their children’s unique behavioral health and growth.

Tovala is a revolutionary in-home cooking solution that makes cooking truly effortless. Whereas other products and services have all attempted to solve the age-old dinner-time dilemma, the sad reality is that all other convenient options require compromise. Tovala changes that—we provide true convenience without the sacrifice, liberating consumers from the never-ending daily dinner burden. The name Tovala is a combination of the Italian word for table, “tavola,” and the Hebrew word for good, “tov.”

How Did The Company Start?

David Rabie and Bryan Wilcox came up with Tovala in 2015 in a quest to eat better. They were tired of takeout, meal kits, frozen food, prepared meals, and even scratch cooking themselves. They wanted the delicious and healthy experience of home cooking every night, but with their busy lives, they just didn’t have the time. They asked themselves—“why do we have to cook every night?” Their mission was to make it easier to eat well.
So they built Tovala—a countertop steam oven that is paired with a gourmet, fresh meal delivery service. Meals are prepped by Tovala’s top chefs and delivered straight to consumers doorsteps where they can automatically and perfectly cook each meal at the scan of a barcode. The Tovala Steam oven cooks each meal on autopilot in under 20 minutes, letting consumers enjoy a delicious, freshly cooked meal with no prep and no cleanup. The meals are all designed by their Chief Culinary Officer, Alexander Plotkin, who brings the culinary creativity he honed at world-renowned restaurants, Noma and Alinea.

The company is based in Chicago, participated in the Y Combinator program in 2016, launched in mid-2017 and has raised $13 million in venture capital to date.

Since launch in mid-2017, Tovala has been quietly gaining a cult-like following among consumers fed-up with current options. The brand frequently hears feedback that Tovala is “the answer to my prayers” and “life changing.” ",3.0

There’s only one thing they haven’t figured out how to do for users. You still need to manually type in the details of your passport, license plate, ID, drivers license, etc, when asked.

Anyline had made it their mission to bridge this gap for users. Since 2013, the Anyline team has worked on it’s patented optical character recognition technology and has already attracted well-known customers.

With the Anyline SDK, smartphone cameras can process written characters in real time, even when offline. This is achieved with the help of a neural network. This means data from an ID can be digitized in the blink of an eye and then verified or validated against information in your application’s backend. Anyline also makes fewer mistakes than people and works 20 times faster.

Learn about how you can support better health care for yourself, your loved ones and your community: https://youtu.be/aATU-zdeF6M 


Our Journey
The inspiration behind Backpack Health was pretty simple: We shared similar problems, and we wanted to solve them.

It all started with Diane and Mark Goldman, who were looking for a better way to manage their son’s chronic condition — for years. Specialist after specialist, hospital form after hospital form, flare up after flare up. Over time, their son’s medical data got scattered, making it hard to make sense of his whole story. Things only got more complicated after they spent four years living outside of their native country – some documents weren’t even in their first language. If people can’t use their own health information to get the help they need, how would researchers ever find the answers their family was waiting for? They were frustrated. And they felt powerless.

Then they met a few like-minded people with a knack for thinking big. Jim Cavan, an avid traveler with a background in emergency medicine and medical research, and a niece who was born with a connective tissue disorder, understood their circumstances all too well. Together they decided it was time for change: People should have access to their whole health history. But they shouldn’t just have access, they should be able to make sense of it, and in whatever language they’re most comfortable using. They should be able to coauthor it and share pieces of it, and they should be able to do all of the same for their loved ones.

Jim and the Goldmans wasted no time assembling a team of people as dedicated to their cause as they were — and that we really are. This journey has had its ups and downs, its hurdles and successes. There were periods of time during which some of us barely slept. But we won't give up, and neither should you.

Here’s the thing: Your health information belongs to you. You have a legal right to it, and that means with the right tools, you can make the most out of your own health narrative. Our goal is to help you do just that.",3.0

Singing is something fundamental to us humans. Singing was a precursor to the evolution of language and speech. Before people could speak their thoughts they communicated through song. Song goes deep inside of us, where plain words cannot reach and lets us find something in ourselves we didn’t know existed. The human voice is the original musical instrument. It is the most popular instrument in the world. Not a single human culture exists that does not sing.

But there are people who don’t sing. 
And that’s why we created Singa. 

Singa is the easiest and most enjoyable service for singing - accessible by anyone, anywhere, anytime and on any device.

Available on mobile, Apple TV and in the browser, Singa’s consumer apps give you access to more than 25 000 high quality songs with karaoke-style lyrics and hundreds of curated singlists for you to sing your heart out to - alone or in a group.

For commercial use at restaurants, events, libraries, schools and more we’ve developed Singa Pro for the Apple iPad - a truly modern, plug and play product for any venue to run its karaoke entertainment on. Consumers can send in their song requests straight from the Singa app. 

We are modernising the way an entire industry works and bringing more singing to the world in the process. Whether you’re a seasoned pro, just starting a new hobby, a notorious shower singer or can’t hold a note to save your life - you should sing. Be it by yourself, organising a karaoke party with friends or by hitting the stage at the nearest Singa powered venue - we are there, whenever and wherever you feel like expressing yourself.",3.0
2050,"Independent travellers are a fast-growing trend in global tourism. From solo travellers, couples, small groups, and an increasing number of families, these independent travellers make up between 350,000 and 500,000 people every year.

Another strong trend is exploration. Travellers are looking for new destinations to visit in addition to the classics and traditional retail travel agents are unable to provide the services for this type of demand. This leads to an increasing number of small operators (experts) that aim to fill the void and accommodate the need for personalized itineraries. The growing demand for this type of travel has led experts to charge large amounts of money, ranging anywhere between $100 and $500 just for designing a tailored trip.

Routeperfect was founded in 2013, drawing on two elements that are characteristic of our creators and employees, a high level of technology and tourism. Since our conception, we have used our time to build, fine tune, and perfect thousands of templates and popular itineraries. With the help of the top tourism experts in the industry and thousands of man-hours, we were able to surpass our initial goal of solely perfecting the touring experience and have sold over $4M in packages.

Routeperfect’s model is based, in addition to knowledge and technology, on several significant advantages that allow us to offer the best prices in the market that only companies that do not reveal rates, opaque prices, can offer.
Through suppliers and direct contracts, Routeperfect offers over 250,000 full packages in real time. On average, these packages are 15% lower than market rates making the total price between $1200 and $1500, considerably less than our competitors.

2074,"We bring together industry-leading tech companies with higher education institutions to build and deliver education programs that prepare learners for the jobs of tomorrow.  

Pathstream was borne out of the observation that nearly all jobs increasingly require digital skills, specifically  “platform-centric” skills on software platforms such as Adobe, Unity, Autodesk, Facebook Ads, etc.  However, these high power, in-demand software platforms are hard to learn through the passive, video-based instructional approach of most online learning. 

Our web-based platform streams our tech partner's high-powered software and allows students to dive right into building their skills. We empower a learn-by-doing approach and eliminate the frustration of downloading and configuring new software that often pushes new learners away. 

We maximize professional and technical preparation by delivering foundational content within the practical, project-based context of a simulated work environment. As a result, students graduate with the skills they need to be desirable in the job market and begin adding value from their first day of hire. Pathstream’s learners not only create a portfolio of projects that demonstrates their skills, but also ultimately earn certifications from the higher ed institution as well as the relevant software platform company, ensuring their efforts translate into actual career mobility.

2076,"Sangha helps districts, schools, teachers and groups to connect, inform, and interact with parents.

Sangha delivers measurable results to schools across US - a high parent reach (average of 75 -100% of parents) and engagement. 

Sangha goes beyond messaging. With Sangha's actionable calendar based platform all parties in a school / out of school org co-ordinate, plan and share events/tasks for upcoming days, weeks and months. A variety of signup requests (forms, eSignatures, payments, fundraising, conference scheduling, volunteering and RSVPs) can be included with any event.

Sangha then manages the parent interaction process, reaching all parents (mobile calendar app, interactive emails, website plugins and print functions), automatically sending parents reminder notifications and sign up requests. Districts, schools and teachers then track and audit parent responses and engagement from within the school calendar web app

Because Sangha is a whole-school solution, our principals and administrators reach 100% of all parents in their school. On average, we reach 75% of parents through our app or email, and of those parents, more than 20% use the Sangha app daily, and more than 40% twice or more a week. 
Perhaps more importantly, we achieved these metrics with over two thirds of our schools qualifying as school-wide Title I (low income).

We believe three things are now clear to schools and districts using Sangha--districts and schools save significant time and money using the Sangha platform; parents prefer Sangha over all other methods of school communication; and Sangha allows districts and schools to reach parents who have previously proved unreachable using other approaches.

2111,"SIXUP is a public benefit corporation and online lending platform whose mission is to lift up the next generation of high-achieving, low-income students in pursuit of a high-quality college education. Our platform combines community, finance and technology to deliver responsible, affordable loans that help students upgrade to and graduate from more selective four-year colleges. We fund the gap between available financial aid and total cost of attendance with loans that do not require credit or a co-signer. At Sixup, we aim to make paying for college simple, accessible and predictable, while keeping a student’s debt as low as possible.

Every year, high-achieving students get accepted to selective four-year institutions but can't afford the rising educational costs and don’t have access to the funding they need to make it through to graduation. These students are often forced to downgrade their dreams, put their lives on a credit card, take on high-interest loans, or, worst of all, drop-out. We believe there is a better way.

Indians today have a healthy appetite for international products but acquiring such products has not been easy; requiring a trip abroad, a request to a visiting NRI aunt, or an expedition to a gray market that offers products of dubious authenticity. Shopping online at international stores comes with its own set of issues - the few stores that do deliver to India charge exorbitantly for international shipping and have no notion of Indian import duties which are calculated and collected from the customer only after the product reaches India. All in all, an expensive, cumbersome process with the potential for a nasty surprise when import duties are finally assessed in India. 20North is dedicated to changing the rules of this game. 

Bringing US stores to your doorstep:  We've forged partnerships with some of the biggest and most trusted US retailers so it doesn't matter how hard it is to get a product - if its available on any US website you will likely find it on 20North and on the off-chance that you don't, we will ""Special Order"" it for you from the US website on which you found it.

From Tag Heuer to Tarantino, Zippos to Zeppelin, Barbie dolls to Barbecue sets, Chinaware to Chopsticks, Karaoke to Kayaks....choose from millions of products from the leading international brands that you trust, pay in Rupees and have them delivered from the US to your doorstep in India.

There really is no limit. Sporting goods, movies, electronics, books, shoes, apparel, furniture and thousands of other products are now just a mouse-click away. Payments can be made with any India issued or international credit or debit card and the price is inclusive of all applicable import duties, shipping costs and handling charges.

2239,"Partender is a business tool that reduces the time it takes owners and managers to do bar inventory from a frustrating 6-24 hours to 15 minutes or less. We do this by digitizing this crazy, archaic paper-pen-clipboard process into a few taps and swipes on iOS & Android. And because Partender's so fast, our customers doing inventory just once-a-week have increased their bottom lines by 6-8% in under 3 months. Like the retail industry, the restaurant industry moved into the 21st century with SKU numbers that automated point-of-sale (POS) systems with supply-chain management. Unfortunately, the bar industry is still stuck in the 19th century. To make matters worse, Bevinco (a bar & eatery auditor) estimates that each bar loses 18-31% (or an overall industry average of 23% per bar) of its inventory to ”shrinkage,” which is a loss of inventory that is not sold. This loss is due to theft, over-pouring, bottle breakage, spillage, and more. That’s almost 1-in-4 drinks, and could be a bar’s profit margin for the year. In addition, research shows that bar managers order less alcohol from distributors after completing inventory because of shrinkage costs. Because the current process of doing liquor inventory takes so long, it’s only done once a week at most. This leaves bars not knowing what their inventory consists of on a daily basis, and leaves them vulnerable to running out of stock before the next reorder. Partender hopes to change this. By providing an easy-to-use app interface in which a bar manager can slide his or her thumb across a virtual bottle to accurately measure liquor levels, Partender reduces the time it takes managers to inventory from hours to minutes, making bars virtually 100% accountable for their inventory.

2315,"Based in Austin Texas, Lessons.com (http://lessons.com) is debuting their marketplace today with the mission to connect students with local teachers in sports, music, academia and performing arts. Right away, Lessons.com has been able to gain traction across the country with over 700 teachers applying in 90 cities.

""Teachers are really kind of flocking to us,"" CEO, Tom Grupa says. ""With the volume of teachers applying with us every day, we are able to hand-pick and vet the best teachers and our unique proposition makes it a really good deal for them.""

For teachers, Lessons.com provides more than just local exposure to new students, including accepting payments online, ability to offer booking packages of multiple lessons, management tools to grow their business, and administrative efforts to help ease growing pains. After all, most teachers don't have a website which limits their ability to market their services online. Teachers have traditionally relied on referrals, ads in local libraries, and Craigslist.

For both students and parents, it's difficult to find a quality teacher for their subject, in their location, at a time that works for them, and at a price they can afford. Lessons.com makes it easy for students to compare prices, read reviews, view a teacher's accreditations, and then make an educated decision.

""Even if you can find a teacher through a referral, it is very hard to compare that teacher with others, even harder to verify the accuracy of that teacher's reviews, and impossible to know if there may have been a closer, more affordable or better matched teacher elsewhere,"" says Grupa.

Startups need to build teams, fast. 

We know that high performing teams in the tech industry are aligned on their mission, goals, and culture, while each individual compliments the skills and problem-solving strategies of their team members. Yet building out these high performing teams takes time and energy that fast-growing startups simply can’t afford to waste.

Our team is trusted by these firms because we care deeply about the both the startups we find talent for, and the candidates we connect with these jobs. 

We know that contingency recruiting works, but we knew that we could make it better by applying data science and full-time Talent Partners to provide a better experience for everyone. 

We’ve learned the patterns that make startup teams successful. In 2014, we decided to build out Talentpair, a recruiting platform that gives our team superpowers . Since then, 17,000 people have been hired using the Talentpair process.

At ChalkTalk, we’re helping teachers discover how the most advanced technology in education isn’t one that requires hours of training or upends pedagogy - it’s technology that runs behind the scenes, personalizing instruction while nudging students along a path of continual success.

ChalkTalk is a remarkable new tool that helps every teacher ‘teach amazing.’ Using fully-adaptive technology, it generates a personalized, supplemental curriculum for high school English Language Arts and Math classes that has shown to dramatically improve student learning outcomes, including state test scores.

Using results from a student placement test, ChalkTalk’s machine-learning software generates standards-aligned curriculum customized to fit within the existing class schedule. Lesson plans, instructional slides, walkthrough examples, and small group practice activities are adaptively generated for the teacher, while personalized practice problems and review exercises are adaptively generated for each student. In this way, ChalkTalk acts as the ultimate teacher’s assistant - scaffolding instruction for each student while using class progress to shape future instruction.

Today, ChalkTalk is used by schools across the United States from New York to Hawaii. After just 15 weeks, every school who used ChalkTalk had their students experience 2-6x more growth on state test scores compared to their peers after a full year of traditional instruction. ",2.0

We founded Luv.it in direct response to an opaque, exploitative, unsustainable fashion industry that’s damaging our planet and its people.

Luv.it is a passion project built by a driven team of digital entrepreneurs and fashion insiders committed to building a better future.

Fashion is the second most polluting industry in the world and plagued with ethical issues, ranging from indefensible wages to unsafe working conditions. While few seem to be engaging in critical conversations about how to address these grave concerns, we believe the industry must change. So we’re leading the charge for more responsibility and accountability.

At Luv.it, we believe that people make principled purchasing decisions when they’re made aware of the social and environmental impact of their choices. We believe people want to identify as conscious, ethical consumers who care about whether factories are safe, whether materials and methods are sustainable, and whether workers are treated humanely.

So we created a commerce platform to give shoppers better alternatives, and help shoppers make informed and inspired decisions about what they wear.

We carefully curate and support a selection of designers that are taking a stand and adopting sustainable and ethical practices in their businesses. We celebrate fashion labels that not only adhere to the acceptable standards of the industry, but strive to raise those standards.

We’re driven by our vision of an elevated, easy-to-use mobile shopping experience and our duty to educate others on the negative impacts of fast fashion. Because we believe our planet is at stake. We know that individual designers and shoppers can make a world of difference with their choices and their voices, so we’re here to shed light on exciting new possibilities.

Just take a look around at the designers featured by Luv.it, and we know you’ll be as inspired as we are.

Middels VraagApp kunnen zij alledaagse vragen stellen en hebben vervolgens snel antwoord van vrijwilligers.
Wij geloven er in dat als je technologie op de juiste manier inzet, het voor deze mensen behulpzaam is om tóch mee te kunnen doen met de maatschappij.
Hoe? Door het kunnen stellen van dagelijkse vragen in een overzichtelijke app met één duidelijk antwoord. Daarnaast door anonimiteit in de app waardoor onzekerheid om iets te vragen afneemt.
Zo zorgt VraagApp ervoor dat deze kwetsbare groep zelfredzamer wordt en worden grote problemen voorkomen.

Een deel van de huidige vragenstellers valt onder een begeleider binnen een zorgorganisatie. 
Doordat zij VraagApp gebruiken worden er zo minder ‘kleine’ vragen gesteld aan de begeleider. Dit betekent meer tijd voor grotere vragen én minder werkdruk, wat vandaag de dag als een groot probleem wordt gezien binnen de zorg.

VraagApp is een initiatief van de belangenvereniging LFB en sociale onderneming 3 Times Impact. De app is in 2017 landelijk gelanceerd. Sinds het bestaan heeft VraagApp de nodige erkenning gekregen door het ontvangen van meerdere nominaties en prijzen:
*2016 – Winnaar Rabo Impact Meeting
*2017 – Winnaar Amsterdam City Fellowship Programma
*2018 – Winnaar Dutch Interactive Awards
*2018 – MKB Innovatie Top 100 van de Kamer van Koophandel 
*2018 – Nominatie World Summit Awards van de Verenigde Naties 
*2018 – Winnaar Digi Omarmprijs 

VraagApp kan worden aangeschaft door zorginstellingen, gemeenten en bedrijven die VraagApp vervolgens introduceren bij cliënten, burgers of werknemers die vaak alledaagse vragen hebben. 

Daarnaast kan VraagApp ook door particulieren gebruikt worden. Download de app in de Play of App Store.

At InsiteVR.com architects and 3D designers can upload existing 3D models, which are then converted and optimized for viewing in virtual reality devices like the Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard or simply on mobile devices.

Trying to understand 3D spaces by looking at static two-dimensional pictures is not intuitive. Communicating those 3D designs to a client, friend or colleague who isn't trained to understand 3D space isn't always trivial either. With virtual reality, architects and designers can effortlessly communicate the essence of their designs, save time and feel confident their viewer understands the design. 

Part of this process means creating an easy-to-understand user interface for exploring and interacting with 3D models in virtual reality. We must bridge the gap between simplicity and functionality in 3D space, a new frontier of design.  

Our goal is to bring down the barrier to creating virtual reality experiences for those who can truly benefit from the immersion and presence that VR provides. Creating a VR experience shouldn't require knowing a technical programming language or paying enough money to people who do. Architects and 3D artists should hone their craft and leave the VR implementation to InsiteVR.  

During this journey, Insite will strive to make VR accessible for both affordable and powerful VR headsets.

// ABOUT JACKRABBIT 

Jackrabbit started in 2012 when our CEO, Jonathan Rosenberg, realized he was dissatisfied with a ""good job"" as a software engineer for a large corporation in town. He was excited about the tech industry’s vast potential especially in areas like mobile (at the time) and wanted to explore those new frontiers. Jon decided to take four months off with $20K in his savings account to see how far he could get in building a business.

(Jon's background is eclectic to say the least. After high school, he rode his bike alone through the US, cooked for dog mushers on a glacier in Alaska, studied computer science at The University of Texas at Austin, and co-founded a guerilla art collective called the Elevator Art Club – which won Austin Chronicle's Best of Austin Art Collective in 2003.)

With the support of the Austin tech ecosystem, especially Capital Factory and 3 Day Startup, Jackrabbit has grown into what it is today.

Our team cares about giving back to the community that's helped us grow and thrive. We host free workshops, hackathons, and iOS and Android meetups around town that bring professionals in our industry together to grow their skills and build community. We also volunteer as mentors for 3 Day Startup and support various efforts to increase diversity in tech and entrepreneurship.

- registering all users in a parking management and access system (including visitors)
- allowing different means of access (e.g. pincode, mobile phone, licence plate reader, etc)
- automatic monthly invoicing of parking lot users
- allowing the sharing of the parking space with surrounding buildings in the case that they have a fully booked parking space (and vice versa)
- making use of the unoccupied parking spaces by renting them out to drivers to generate extra revenue
- eliminates manual administrative work, saving time and money

As a member of the sharing economy, Mobypark also provides a platform on which private parking owners can rent out their parking spaces. These can include individuals who own a parking space, but simply don't use it all the time, hotels which are not fully booked (and therefore have spare parking spaces), office buildings, and more. The Mobypark platform opens up private parking spaces to members of the public, maximising existing parking spaces and eliminating the need to build new ones. 

The Mobypark platform allows drivers to:

See real-time availability of nearby parking spots (saving an average of 20 minutes per driver)
Reserve a parking spot in advance (ideal for vacations/trips)
Receive up to a 70% discount

// ABOUT JACKRABBIT 

Jackrabbit started in 2012 when our CEO, Jonathan Rosenberg, realized he was dissatisfied with a ""good job"" as a software engineer for a large corporation in town. He was excited about the tech industry’s vast potential especially in areas like mobile (at the time) and wanted to explore those new frontiers. Jon decided to take four months off with $20K in his savings account to see how far he could get in building a business.

(Jon's background is eclectic to say the least. After high school, he rode his bike alone through the US, cooked for dog mushers on a glacier in Alaska, studied computer science at The University of Texas at Austin, and co-founded a guerilla art collective called the Elevator Art Club – which won Austin Chronicle's Best of Austin Art Collective in 2003.)

With the support of the Austin tech ecosystem, especially Capital Factory and 3 Day Startup, Jackrabbit has grown into what it is today.

Our team cares about giving back to the community that's helped us grow and thrive. We host free workshops, hackathons, and iOS and Android meetups around town that bring professionals in our industry together to grow their skills and build community. We also volunteer as mentors for 3 Day Startup and support various efforts to increase diversity in tech and entrepreneurship. 

The Jackrabbit team is proudly located in Austin, Texas. ",3.0

Tekla - the deaf dog who taught us how to listen

The OneMind Dogs training methodology was created by our lead coach Janita Leinonen when her Border Collie Tekla suddenly lost her hearing in 2003. Tekla taught us that the connection between human and dog does not need words. We simply need to learn to listen. Every dog in the world speaks this language, we teach OneMind Dogs methodology to the people. The goal of OneMind Dogs is to help you to understand your dog’s natural behavior.

OneMind Dogs develops its’ online service and coach network

The worldwide demand for live training sessions based on the OneMind Dogs methodology has been so high, that the company has been able to meet only a fraction of it. The online service was developed to fulfill the demand by offering people more possibilities to learn the methodology. Currently the company focuses on developing the online service and especially the community side of it, as well as international growth mainly on the North American market.

Currently the OneMind Dogs online service focuses on dog agility but the company plans to add content that interests the everyday dog owner and helps them in interacting with their canine friends.

2984,"Waleteros provides an easy, quick, transparent, fair, trusted, low-cost, human way for underbanked consumers to access and move money.

WALETEROS: THE WHY

The banking system in the U.S. and across North America can be intimidating and unwelcoming to the working class. Many of the products and services most needed by low-income and immigrant populations aren’t offered, such as immediate check cashing, low-interest microloans, bill pay, or inexpensive money transfers. In-person customer service in the hushed lobbies of banks feels cold and impersonal, even alienating, while online help is more frustrating than helpful. Hidden fees take money from people who can least afford it. 

Check cashing stores in the United States (and similar businesses in Latin America) have somewhat filled the gap, but at a steep cost to the consumer. These service providers offer a more welcoming atmosphere, but the long lines (especially on payday!), excessive fees and inconvenience are a waste of time and money.

Waleteros was created to provide an easy, quick, transparent, fair, trusted, low-cost, human way for low-wage workers in Latin America and the U.S. — both the unbanked and the underbanked — to access and move money. Its trusted platform and personalized customer service quickly and inexpensively give people access to cash and credit, allowing them to live easier and less stressful lives. They can cash a check in minutes and have access to their money right away; they can pay a bill or send money to friends and family abroad—even if they don’t have a social security number. Unlike other products, Waleteros is totally transparent and its fees are minimal.

Waleteros believes in what it calls the “Waleteros Lifestyle.” The mission of the company is to take the frustration, stress and inconvenience out of financial transactions so its customers can enjoy their lives with the peace of mind that their money is readily available and secure. ",3.0

3000,"Comroads is the world’s first social network for drivers to share vital video evidence when and where needed. Comroads is focused on building a community of drivers who can use the app to easily retrieve, upload and share their dashcam footage, helping fellow drivers prove their traffic cases against those who don’t want to take responsibility for causing an accident. 

Traffic accidents occur quickly, and often times the driver responsible for causing the crash leaves the scene of the incident before proper information can be exchanged. While a single dashcam can help catch some of the details, one dashcam is often not enough to provide a full picture of what happened. 

Comroads was built to help overcome this challenge. The app works with standard WiFi enabled off-the-shelf dashcams. By bundling the dashcam footage from all the drivers who were nearby when an accident occurs, Comroads will be able to provide victims with a 360º view into exactly what happened, helping prove the innocence of the victims and serving justice to those at fault - even if the driver refuses to accept responsibility. 

Comroads is simple to install and use. After downloading the Android app, users just pair their phones with their dashcam using the app. The app will then automatically detect when a car is in motion. While in driving mode, the app anonymously maps the drivers’ trip and matches it with the dash cam footage, allowing users to point to a location on the map and then easily share the footage from that location. 

If a driver is involved in an accident, he or she will be able to press the accident point on the map of their route in the Comroads app, allowing them to see if any other Comroads community members were there so that they can request videos from their dashcams. When there’s an incident reported by a Comroads community member, Comroads will be able to locate nearby drivers who may have relevant footage. Drivers will then be able to request footage and view what happened – again and again - allowing them to see the accident from different angles, before submitting to insurers.  

By remembering where a car is parked, Comroads will be able to protect vehicles when they are not on the road. If the car is damaged while it is parked, the owner will be able to press the location on the map inside the Comroads app to see if anyone from the Comroads community recorded the incident. 

The videos that are shared are completely anonymous and Comroads does not have any partnerships with law enforcement or government authorities, nor is uploader information shared with any 3rd party. 

Comroads currently supports the Yi smart dashcam, Viofo WR1 and the Viofo A129 and will be introducing support for additional models over the next year.",3.0

Get in touch if you want to play a key role in a high-impact growing startup — and if you are cool with building stuff that save people’s lives. (!)

We built an online medical search engine supporting physicians in identifying genes that can explain certain rare conditions. Rare diseases (all 7,000 known types combined) affect over 350m people (more than cancer!) and take on average 7 years to diagnose in clinics. The tool is used by thousands of doctors from 140 countries and has attracted acclaim from top researchers and clinical doctors in the field.

3002,"MyCena: a new password security solution offering peace of mind that you are protecting yourself and your business against cyber criminals.

In our increasingly digitalised world, our need for passwords is rising. Today, many internet users will have upwards of 100 passwords, making it almost impossible to accurately remember them all. As a result, users often employ simple password combinations that are easy to recall.

And therein lays the greatest challenge to modern information technology security. Easily remembered passwords tend to be weak or reused, and stored locally on post-it notes or a spreadsheet.
  
Cyber-criminals love this kind of user. Verizon’s Data Breach Investigations Report states that over 80% of hacking-related breaches were linked to weak, reused or stolen passwords.

Does your organisation take cyber-security seriously?

Cloud password managers might seem convenient but conceal three potential flaws:
• If your master password is compromised, all your passwords are in 
        danger. 
• Centralised password storage makes an appealing target for hackers.
• The cloud is increasingly under attack – would you leave your house 
        keys on the cloud or keep them with you?

MyCena is based on a fully distributed risk-model that stores encrypted passwords locally on a device. 
• Instead of storing all passwords behind a master password, each 
        password is stored under one, two or three levels of security depending 
        on their sensitivity.
• Users access their passwords with a unique combination of fingerprint, 
        PIN, lock pattern and voice pass-phrase.
• Only you can access your passwords: if you lose your device, you simply 
        upload your backup onto a new device.

Benefits 
• No master password = no single failure point  
• Strong password generator
• Passwords encrypted inside your device
• Three levels of security
• Use on multiple devices
• Encrypted backups
• Increase IT and staff productivity",1.0

We also have community pages for all our locations throughout the world. People who will not travel right away, but are interested or want to know more about a certain city, national park, hiking trail, mountain or an airport, can ask questions and get help from other users using real-time chat and question answers. Community members can mark themselves as locals as well.

This platform will also lower the number of hiking accidents, as a lot of people will be able to hike in groups. All users have a customized feed, based on their interest, location, travel destinations etc. They can post their updates and pictures with all the travel and adventure geeks out there.
