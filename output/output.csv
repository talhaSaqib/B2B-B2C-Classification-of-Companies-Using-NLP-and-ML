In addition, its SaaS Risk Management Automation solution makes conducting and reporting the findings from risk assessments to non-IT executives simple, fast and repeatable. 

Delphiis specializes in healthcare, helping many of the leading academic and hospital systems effectively and cost efficiently strengthen the power of their information security departments ensuring patient safety across the enterprise. 

The Story Behind Delphiis:

After decades in the information security industry and consulting for many Fortune 500 and Global 1000 organizations, Delphiis saw and heard the same problems over and over again with very little variation. Delphiis founder Mike Gentile went so far as to co-author multiple books on the topic, CISO Handbook and CISO Soft Skills.

Delphiis discovered that there are huge gaps in the development of healthy security systems within most organizations. At the same time, the environment in which most security programs must survive are also becoming more and more difficult to navigate. Delphiis' mantra is simple: control what you can. As there are factors outside of your control like budgetary constraints, workload, threats, infrastructures, culture, and so on.

The core DNA that has been embedded into Delphiis' Risk Management Automation application is Delphiis' ability to collaborate and execute through simple-but-effective methodology used in projects in leading organizations around the world.

581,"SIMmersion provides advanced training for difficult conversations through interactive systems featuring simulations. These face-to-face conversation simulations allow users to acquire information, practice, and build different skills, such as making a sale, screening a patient for alcohol abuse, criminal investigative interviews, and employee performance counseling. SIMmersion simulations use a patented non-branching logic that gives users a new experience with each conversation. Video-based characters are used to create life-like, challenging situations. Instant feedback from an on-screen coach, instant replay, and a post-assessment allow users to learn without the need for any outside support.

Users converse with characters who have fully-developed personalities, motives, emotions, and memories that change each time the simulation is played. Users talk with the characters using a microphone, or they may select what to say by using a mouse. The characters decide how to respond based on the rapport built between themselves and the user, the history of the conversation, and several other factors. This results in realistic, highly-engaging conversations that are never the same twice. 

SIMmersion's products are used to train lasting skills and for testing. They can be delivered over the internet or on DVDs. They can even be delivered on smart phones or tablets.  SIMmersion’s browser-based products are SCORM compliant and PC systems can be made 508 compliant.",1.0,1.0

Technicians receive a legit certification that students and employees can use for future employment purposes!

Why was Rapidtech developed?
-It started simply because there is a shortage of skilled wokrers in the United States. In its original form, it started as TDP (Technician Development Plan). From there, it evolved into a system using several parts and pieces that make it more than just education. 

-In 2009, during the recession Steve Holland developed this system as a way to rapidly develop skilled workers. His business was in the HVAC space and during the recession the replacements business tapered off. This resulted in more focus on the service side of the business. With great success, Steve grew his service business but could not find qualified technicians.

WhyTry began in January of 1996, when a professor asked Christian Moore how he had come so far academically despite his severe learning differences.

As Christian thought about this question, he wrote the words, “Why Try?” on the top of a piece of paper. Below the question, he wrote 15 principles that he used to overcome his challenges. Later, while in graduate school, Christian began using pictures to teach his ""WhyTry"" principles as a counselor at an alternative high school. He recognized that the youth he was helping were overwhelmingly visual learners, so talking to them was always going to have a limited effect. He presented his ideas and visual tools to a local school district, which used them to reduce truancy and failure in their most at-risk students.

The WhyTry Program is now in use in over 16,000 schools and 500 school districts in all 50 states and countries worldwide.
